To play tunes you need a player 
I found "VGMPLAY" on a Google forum 
https://groups.google.com/g/rc2014-z80/c/9nHnETJzGKU/m/lCmy5DjCCAAJ

get the zip file "VGMPLAY.ZIP" by Marco Maccaferri rewritten from the version here on the Github by J.B.Langston 

use gran searle's "DOWNLOAD.COM" on the CPM side and "BINARY to CPM PACKAGE" for windows 

open "FilePackage.exe" using right click, open as administrator options - this should launch the file packager
transfer over the content of the VGMPLAY.ZIP file ,
use select all and copy from the notepad file
then paste to the teraterm window ......... wait 
you may want to set the delay per character and delay per line to 1 us each in the serial settings

most important file is VGMPLAY.BIN
once this is transfered to the CPM system 
type 
A> REN VGMPLAY.COM = VGMPLAY.BIN   'TO RENAME THE BIM FILE TO AN EXECUATABLE 
check with DIR
TRANSFER OVER A *.vgm FILE TO PLAY   i LIKE LEMMIN01.VGM to test with 

type A> VGMPLAY LEMMIN01.VGM   ' IF ALL IS WELL THE MUSIC SHOULD PLAY 


the music files can be found here https://vgmrips.net/packs/

ALOT OF THE MUSIC IS ZIPED UP as VGZ - you can extract these and rename with a VGM extension - be sure to use a simple filename 
8 characters
