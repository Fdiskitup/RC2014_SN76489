So there I was with my new RC2014 Card all constructed and ready to play 
I have it set for all the defaults with JP2 set to mono but the second SN76489AN is removed from U5 

my first attempt was to output some random values to the FF port address using O in the monitor, no luck 

next I booted "MBASIC.COM" microsoft basic for CP/M and spent some time randomly pushing values out the port :
eventually I figured out that the chip needs to be communicated with in a nicer way.  

10 OUT &HFF, &H9F  ' Send the frequency latch byte (tone channel 0, frequency)
20 OUT &HFF, &H20  ' Send the low-byte frequency data
30 OUT &HFF, &H8F  ' Send the attenuation latch byte (tone channel 0)
40 OUT &HFF, &H0F  ' Set attenuation to 0 (maximum volume)
50 END

this gave me a nice pure tone out of the speaker 

however, this wont shut off until you give it some more instructions 

110 OUT &HFF, &H9F  ' Send the frequency latch byte MUTE the PSG (tone channel 0, frequency)
120 OUT &HFF, &HBF  ' Send the low-byte frequency data
130 OUT &HFF, &HDF  ' Send the attenuation latch byte (tone channel 0)
140 OUT &HFF, &HFF  ' Set attenuation to 255 (minimum volume)
150 END

ok so that should be enough to get a beep
